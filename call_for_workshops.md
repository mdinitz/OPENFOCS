##### FOCS 2019 will hold a Workshop and Tutorial Day on November 9th. We invite groups of interested researchers to submit workshop or tutorial proposals. #####

### Important Dates

Submission deadline:	**May 24, 2019**<br>
Notification:	**June 21, 2019**<br>
Workshop Day:	**November 9th**

### About

The FOCS 2019 Workshop and Tutorial Day provides an informal forum for researchers to discuss important research questions, directions, and challenges of the field. We also encourage workshops that focus on connections between theoretical computer science and other areas, topics that are not well represented at FOCS, new directions, and open problems. The program may also include tutorials, each consisting of one or a few survey talks on a particular area.

### Format

We have room for three workshops/tutorials running in parallel for a morning session of approximately 3 hours (plus a break) and an afternoon session of approximately 1.5 hours. Workshops or tutorials may be either full-day (4.5 hours), half-day (3 hours), or quarter-day (1.5 hours).  The quarter-day format is intended mainly as an option for tutorials.

### Proposal Submission

Workshop and tutorial proposals should, ideally, fit one page. Please include a list of names and email addresses of the organizers, a brief description of the topic and the goals of the workshop or tutorial, the proposed workshop format (invited talks, contributed talks, contributed posters, panel, etc.), and proposed or tentatively confirmed speakers if known. If your proposal is accepted and you wish to solicit contributed talks (which we strongly encourage), we can link to your call-for-contributions from the FOCS 2019 page. Feel free to contact the Chairs of the Workshop and Tutorials Committee directly or at the email address below if you have any questions.

### Submission Deadline
Proposals should be submitted by **May 24, 2019** via email to <a href="mailto:focs2019workshops@gmail.com">focs2019workshops@gmail.com</a>.<br>
Proposers will be notified by **June 21, 2019** whether their proposals have been accepted.
