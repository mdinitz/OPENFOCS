## Restaurants

There are many excellent restaurants near the conference venue.  For a reasonably comprehensive list, see <a href="https://baltimore.org/restaurants">this list</a> maintained by <a href="https://baltimore.org/">Visit Baltimore</a>.  The Hyatt is in the "Inner Harbor" neighborhood, and is within walking distance of Federal Hill, Little Italy, Harbor East, Downtown West & Bromo Tower Arts, and the Stadium Area.  Yelp and Google Maps are also good resources.  

## Events

The beginning of FOCS overlaps with the end of <a href="https://brilliantbaltimore.com/light-city/about-light-city/">Light City</a> in the Inner Harbor, very close to the Hyatt.  Check out the <a href="https://brilliantbaltimore.com/schedule/light-art-exhibits/">list</a> and <a href="https://brilliantbaltimore.com/plan-your-visit/">map</a> of exhibits.
