The Job Market Posters is a new effort at FOCS aimed at graduating students and postdocs who are on the job market and who wish to showcase their work to the community.  

Interested applicants must submit a one-paragraph text abstract <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1UnOUHfVzvAdhip_diUZeCspxvQ5vj-Tu2xev8UZ9A-g">here</a>; this will be used to check scope and suitability.  (Being an author on a FOCS 2019 paper is not required.)

The deadline for submissions is September 6, 2019, and the authors will be notified by the end of September.

If accepted, authors are expected to register for FOCS, attend the conference, and present their poster.  Suitable space will be reserved at the conference for displaying the posters; exact details are TBD.

Please submit any questions or comments to <a href="mailto:focs2019jobmarketposters@gmail.com">focs2019jobmarketposters@gmail.com</a>
