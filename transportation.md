## Rail <a name="rail">

Baltimore is on the Northeast Corridor rail line, so is easily accessible by train.  <a href="https://www.amtrak.com/home.html">Amtrak</a> serves intercity routes, and the local commuter train system, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MARC_Train">MARC train</a>, has frequent trains to and from Union Station in Washington, DC.

- Amtrak and the MARC Penn line trains stop at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Station_(Baltimore)">Baltimore Penn Station</a> in midtown Baltimore.  Amtrak trains from Washington Union cost approximately $20 and take 40 minutes, while the MARC Penn trains from Union cost $8 and take approximately an hour.  From Penn Station, the purple line of the <a href="https://www.charmcitycirculator.com/">Charm City Circulator</a> or the silver or green lines of the <a href="https://www.mta.maryland.gov/schedule?type=local-bus">MTA local bus</a> will take you directly to the Hyatt.

- The MARC Camden line terminates at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camden_Station">Camden Station</a> in downtown Baltimore, a 6 minute walk from the Hyatt.  Trains from Washington, DC take approximately 75 minutes and cost $8.  Note that the Camden line has extremely limited hours.

## Air

Baltimore is served locally by <a href="https://www.bwiairport.com">Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport</a> (BWI), and is also accessible from <a href="https://www.flyreagan.com/dca/reagan-national-airport">Reagan National Airport</a> (DCA) and <a href="https://www.flydulles.com/iad/dulles-international-airport">Dulles International Airport</a> (IAD).

##### Directions from BWI

The easiest way from BWI to the Hyatt is the <a href="https://www.mta.maryland.gov/schedule/lightrail">light rail</a>.  You can get on the light rail at BWI, and exit at either the Camden Yards station or the Pratt Street station, both of which are approximately a six minute walk to the Hyatt.  The train should take approximately 30 minutes, and cost $1.90.

It is also possible to take a MARC or Amtrak train from BWI to Baltimore Penn Station, by first taking the shuttle bus from BWI to the BWI MARC station.

A taxi/uber/lyft from BWI to the Hyatt should take about 20 minutes and cost somewhere between $25-$35.

##### Directions from DCA

You can easily get from DCA to Washington Union Station on the <a href="https://www.wmata.com/">DC Metro</a> by taking either the yellow line to Gallery Place and then the red line to Union, or the blue line to Metro Center and then the red line to Union.  This should take approximately 30 minutes.  From Union Station, see the directions under <a href="#rail">Rail<a>.

##### Directions from IAD

As with DCA, the first step is to reach Washington Union Station, after which you can take a train to Baltimore (see <a href="#rail">Rail</a>).  There are two main way to get to Union Station:

1. Take the <a href="https://www.flydulles.com/iad/silver-line-express-bus-metrorail-station">Silver Line Express bus</a> to Wiehle-Reston metro station.  From Wiehle-Reston, you can take the silver line of the DC metro to Metro Center, and then the red line to Union.  

2. Take the WMATA 5a bus to L'Enfant Plaza, and then the green or yellow line to Gallery Place followed by the red line to Union.
